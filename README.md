# From Zero to Internship Ready

## Introduction

I have tought several people how to become internship ready in software development without any prior knowledge on the topic. My methodology revolves around creating several projects that will build up your portfolio. By the end of this guide, you will have what is required to get an internship in either web development or app development. 


##Step 1: Python

Whether your goal is to develop apps or websites, I recommend learning the basics of Python. Python is a general purpose programming language which means it can be used in many different situations. You can develop desktop applications with it like a word processor (think Microsoft Word) or a calculator. You can also use Python can also be used to build websites. Some big examples of this include Instagram, Pinterest, and the NASA website.

To start learning the basics of Python, I usually refer people to this free course on Udacity:

It is a very good introduction to programming for people with no background knowledge. The course also walks you through a few small projects that you can add to your portfolio such as:

1. a program to draw shapes on the screen
2. a program that sends texts to your phone
3. a program to display your favorite movies in a website that also allows you to watch the trailers

Now that you have learned the basics of your first programming language, it's time to move onto the foundations of website building.
